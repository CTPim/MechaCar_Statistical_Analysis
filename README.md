## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Linear Regression Results](/images/MechaCar_Part1.png/)

According to the results of the linear regression, vehicle length and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. With the R-Squared value being .7149, it can be said that this linear model can predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. The slope of this linear model is not considered to be zero.

According to the above images, the current manufacturing data is meeting the design specification for all manufacturing lots in total. The total variance across all lots is 62.29 PSI. Lots 1 and 2 meet the design specifications, with variances of .97 and 7.46 PSI, respectively. Lot 3 has a variance of 170.286, indicating that it does not meet the design specifications.
